# yasb config

  This yasb config actually has 2 variants, one usings a dot design for the komorebi workspaces, and another which uses numbers, both are labeled respectively within the yasb folder of the repo.

# komorebi

  For the most part the komorebi config is the default, only differences being that in workspace 2 it is a floating workspace, and the border colors for active and inactive windows have been updated to fit the Catppuccin color scheme.

# Wallpapers

  I plan on adding more wallpaper later, but for now I have included 4 wallpapers of the kessoku band members, which have been partially edited to better fit the color palette. All wallpapers are then used in the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1509243786">CWAV Engine</a> on Wallpaper Engine
  to add both particle effects and the audio visualizer.

# Other themed programs (Firefox, Discord, etc.)
  
  All other program themes are just using the official Catppuccin ports from the <a href="https://catppuccin.com/ports">Catppuccin</a> site.
